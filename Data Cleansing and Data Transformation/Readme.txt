Data Cleansing, Transformation, and Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing, cleaning, and transforming data from an online electronics store to prepare for future analysis and modeling. The assignment includes three main tasks:

Tasks Overview
Data Cleansing:

Identify and correct anomalies in dirty data, impute missing values, and remove outliers from provided CSV files.
Outputs cleaned datasets with solutions for dirty, missing, and outlier data issues.
Documentation includes a Jupyter Notebook detailing the cleansing methodology and approaches used.
Data Reshaping and Transformation:

Analyze property and suburb data for normalization and transformation requirements to prepare for linear regression modeling.
Apply transformations (standardization, scaling, etc.) to ensure features are on the same scale and exhibit linear relationships with the target variable.
Record findings and transformations in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.
Project Reflection:

Participate in feedback and reflective sessions to refine approaches.
Provide a reflective report that summarizes the feedback received, adjustments made, and insights gained.
Submission Components
Cleaned Data Files: CSV files for cleaned, imputed, and outlier-removed data.
Notebooks and Scripts: Python scripts for each task and Jupyter Notebooks with detailed methodology.
Reflective Report: A PDF documenting the iterative learning process and application of feedback.
