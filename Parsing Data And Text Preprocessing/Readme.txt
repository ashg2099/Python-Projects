Textual Data Analysis and EDA Project
This project focuses on processing and analyzing Google Review data through various data extraction, text preprocessing, and exploratory analysis tasks. The assignment is structured into five main tasks, each designed to extract insights and prepare data for further analysis or modeling.

Tasks Overview
Data Parsing:

Parses review data from semi-structured .txt and .xlsx files.
Outputs structured data into a CSV file, summarizing metrics like review counts, text review counts, and response counts for each business.
Also creates a JSON file with detailed fields, including reviewer info, ratings, review text, and presence of media attachments, formatted in a hierarchical structure.
Text Pre-Processing:

Transforms extracted review text into numerical representations suitable for NLP models.
Generates a vocabulary file of unique tokens (unigrams and bigrams) after performing tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and bigram extraction.
Produces a count vector file for each business, showing token frequency in a sparse format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducts a comprehensive EDA on the processed review data.
Uncovers 2-5 data-driven insights, visualizing patterns and trends in customer reviews.
Analyzes main data alongside auxiliary metadata (for HD grading) to provide deeper insights into customer feedback and engagement.
Video Presentation:

Summarizes key findings from the EDA in a 5-8 minute presentation.
Highlights methodology, insights, and practical implications with visual aids, explaining the relevance of each finding.
Development History:

Documents incremental progress with a detailed timeline, showcasing project evolution.
Includes version screenshots and records of collaborative work, illustrating key milestones and modifications.
Submission Requirements
The final submission includes:

Task-specific files: JSON, CSV, vocabulary (vocab.txt), and count vector (countvec.txt) files for structured data.
Python Scripts and Notebooks: .py files for each task for code verification and .ipynb notebooks with methodology explanations and code output.
Presentation Video: A concise video highlighting EDA findings.
